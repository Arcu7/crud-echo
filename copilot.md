# files: I'm trying to implement clean architecture for this go project. Am i doing good here or is there any changes/improvements that can be made

  Copilot ───

Your implementation is a good start for clean architecture, but there are areas for improvement to better align with clean architecture principles. Here are some suggestions:

---

### 1. **Separation of Concerns**

- **Current Issue**: Your `BookHandler` directly interacts with the database (`gorm.DB`) and contains business logic.
- **Improvement**: Introduce a use case/service layer between the handler and the database. The handler should only handle HTTP requests and responses, delegating business logic to the use case layer.

---

### 2. **Validation**

- **Current Issue**: Validation is tightly coupled with the `echo.Context` in your handlers.
- **Improvement**: Move validation logic to the use case layer or a dedicated validation service. This decouples validation from the web framework.

---

### 3. **Error Handling**

- **Current Issue**: Errors are returned as `echo.NewHTTPError`, which ties your code to the Echo framework.
- **Improvement**: Use custom error types or a centralized error handling mechanism. Map these errors to HTTP responses in the handler layer.

---

### 4. **Testing**

- **Current Issue**: Your tests for `BookHandler` are missing. You have tests for `UserHandler`, but they are tightly coupled with the database and HTTP framework.
- **Improvement**: Write unit tests for `BookHandler` and mock the use case/service layer instead of the database. This ensures tests are independent of the database and framework.

---

### 5. **Dependency Injection**

- **Current Issue**: Dependencies like `gorm.DB` are directly instantiated in the handler.
- **Improvement**: Use dependency injection to pass dependencies into the handler. This makes the code more testable and adheres to the Dependency Inversion Principle.

---

### 6. **Folder Structure**

- **Current Issue**: Your folder structure mixes concerns (e.g., `internal/inbound/handlers` contains both HTTP handlers and business logic).
- **Improvement**: Restructure your project to separate concerns:

  ```
  internal/
    domain/          # Entities and interfaces
    usecase/         # Business logic
    repository/      # Data access logic
    delivery/        # HTTP handlers
  ```

### Example Refactor for `BookHandler`

#### [file:internal/delivery/http/book_handler.go](internal/delivery/http/book_handler.go) line:17-33

```go
func (h BooksHandler) CreateBook(c echo.Context) error {
 b := new(models.Books)
 if err := c.Bind(b); err != nil {
  return c.JSON(http.StatusBadRequest, helper.CustomResponse(false, err.Error()))
 }

 if err := h.BookUseCase.CreateBook(b); err != nil {
  return c.JSON(http.StatusInternalServerError, helper.CustomResponse(false, err.Error()))
 }

 return c.JSON(http.StatusOK, helper.CustomResponse(true, "Book has been created"))
}
```

#### [file:internal/usecase/book_usecase.go](internal/usecase/book_usecase.go) line:1-20

```go
package usecase

import (
 "crud-echo/internal/models"
 "crud-echo/internal/repository"
)

type BookUseCase struct {
 Repo repository.BookRepository
}

func (uc *BookUseCase) CreateBook(book *models.Books) error {
 // Add business logic here if needed
 return uc.Repo.Create(book)
}
```

#### [file:internal/repository/book_repository.go](internal/repository/book_repository.go) line:1-20

```go
package repository

import (
 "crud-echo/internal/models"
 "gorm.io/gorm"
)

type BookRepository struct {
 DB *gorm.DB
}

func (r *BookRepository) Create(book *models.Books) error {
 return r.DB.Create(book).Error
}
```

---

### 7. **Documentation**

- **Current Issue**: Your `copilot.md` file provides good guidance but lacks details on clean architecture principles.
- **Improvement**: Add documentation on how the layers interact and the responsibilities of each layer.

Let me know if you'd like help implementing any of these changes!
